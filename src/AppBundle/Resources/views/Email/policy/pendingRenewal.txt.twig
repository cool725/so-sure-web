Itâ€™s time to renew with so-sure ðŸ“±

Dear Dear {{ policy.user.name }},

We're just emailing to let you know that your so-sure policy {{ policy.policyNumber }} is due to expire on {{ policy.end | date('d M Y', 'Europe/London') }}.

Your renewal premium will be Â£{{ policy.nextPolicy.premium.monthlyPremiumPrice|number_format(2, '.', ',') }} per month.

For comparison the premium paid last year was Â£{{ policy.premium.monthlyPremiumPrice|number_format(2, '.', ',') }} per month.

The excess for your policy is
{% if (policy.policyTerms.isPicSureEnabled and policy.picSureStatus == 'approved') or (policy.policyTerms.isPicSureEnabled and policy.picSureStatus == 'preapproved')  %}
Damage claims: &pound;{{ policy.nextPolicy.premium.picSureExcess.damage }}
Warranty claims: &pound;{{ policy.nextPolicy.premium.picSureExcess.warranty }}
Loss and Theft Claims: &pound;{{ policy.nextPolicy.premium.picSureExcess.loss }}
{% else %}
Damage claims: &pound;{{ policy.nextPolicy.premium.excess.damage }}
Warranty claims: &pound;{{ policy.nextPolicy.premium.excess.warranty }}
Loss and Theft Claims: &pound;{{ policy.nextPolicy.premium.excess.loss }}
{% endif %}

You should check that the level of cover is appropriate for your needs and, if you wish, compare prices and over offered by other providers.

{% if policy.potValue > 0 %}

We also see that youâ€™ve been busily filling up your Reward Pot, which is now worth Â£{{ policy.potValue|number_format(2, '.', ',') }} ðŸ’°

Provided that neither you nor your connections make a claim before the end of your current policy, your monthly premium will be reduced to Â£{{ policy.nextPolicy.premium.getAdjustedStandardMonthlyPremiumPrice(policy.potValue)|number_format(2, '.', ',') }}. If youâ€™d prefer a different arrangement (such as a lump-sum payment or policy termination) click here:

{{ renew_url }}

If we donâ€™t hear from you, we will automatically renew your policy and use your Reward Pot to reduce your premium for the coming year, starting on {{ start_date | date('d M Y', 'Europe/London') }}. Once renewed, we will send you a confirmation email that will include your new policy documents.

{% else %}

We noticed that you havenâ€™t been filling up your Reward Pot, which would have added up to Â£{{ policy.maxPot|number_format(2, '.', ',') }} over the last year.

Remember that every connection you make on so-sure earns money for your Reward Pot, which can reduce your premium. To fill up your Reward Pot, after youâ€™ve renewed your policy, all you need to do is share your personal code with friends and family. Why not give it a try?

If we donâ€™t hear from you, we will renew your policy, starting on {{ start_date | date('d M Y', 'Europe/London') }}. Once renewed, we will send you a confirmation email that will include your new policy documents.

{% endif %}

Thank you for choosing so-sure and please don't hesitate to get in touch with any questions.

Best regards,

Dylan Bourguignon
CEO - so-sure
