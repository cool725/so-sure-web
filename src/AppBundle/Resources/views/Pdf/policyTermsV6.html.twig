                •  in a cafe or pub you leave your mobile phone on the table when you go to the bar to pick up your drink instead of taking it with you
                <br />
                •  leaving your mobile phone on display in your car
                <br />
                •  leaving your mobile phone in the care of someone you don't know well
                <br />
                •  if you are at the gym and you leave your mobile phone on a bench in the changing rooms rather than taking it with you or locking it in a locker
                <br />
                All of these examples increase the risk of your mobile phone being lost, stolen or damaged and may result in your claim being declined.  These examples are only to help you understand what's covered and are not the only scenarios a claim could be rejected.

    <h4>
        Reward Pot
    </h4>
    <p>
        Our concept is built on small scale mutualisation of risk between you and your friends and contacts (“Connections”) (and collectively “Group”). You will not be paid introductory fees. But if the performance of your Group produces good results together, then we will “reward” you by making premium rebates to you as set put below.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your Group can be as small or large as you want but your Reward Pot is limited to 80% of the premium shown on your policy schedule (the Reward Pot Limit). For each member of your Group who joins within 60 days of the start date of your policy, £10 is put into your Reward Pot, up to the Reward Pot Limit but this is reduced to £2 if one of your Group members makes a claim within your first 60 days of your policy start. For each member of your Group that joins after 60 days from the start of your policy, £2 is put into your Reward Pot, up to the Reward Pot Limit. Each of your Group members also has a Reward Pot associated to their Connections, which operates in the same way as yours (so money will also be added to their Reward Pot when you connect to them).
    </p>
    <p>
        Example of your Reward Pot value, if your insurance premium is £60 and your Group members join in the first 60 days:

            If your Reward Pot is worth less than £40 and one of your Group claims, your Reward Pot is reduced to £0 (zero pounds).

    <p>
        For every policy renewal, you can choose to keep the same Group or change it. Hence, at the beginning of your Policy Period you will have the opportunity to either a) re-connect with your existing Group members, b) change your Group Members had in the prior year, or c) add more connections to your Group (up until your Reward Pot is worth 80% of your insurance premium).
    </p>
    <p>
        If your Group do not claim during your year of insurance, the Reward Pot is paid out to you. If you renew your policy with us for another year, your Reward Pot can either be

    <ol type="i">
        <li>
            applied as a credit to reduce your following year's premium payment(s); or

            rebated to you as a lump sum payment.

    <p>
        If you do not wish to renew your policy, we will pay you out in full the value of your Reward Pot as a lump sum payment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lump sum payments are made within 45 days of your policy ending as long as none of your Group has submitted a claim for an incident that took place before the end of your policy term. For example, if your policy ends on 3rd March and your Reward Pot was worth £48 and none of your Group submits a claim by 31st March, we will payout £48 to you by the 17th April.

We may ask for evidence of this to support any claim for the Loss or Theft of your mobile phone.</strong> This must be done within 7 days of Loss or Theft, but if you wish to claim for any unauthorised network charges you will need to report the Theft/Loss to your network provider within 24 hours of the Theft/Loss.         </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Police:</strong> report it to the Police within 7 days

        What you need to know about the claims process
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            We need to know that the mobile phone you are claiming for is yours or a family member's (or owned by the business if this is a business policy):
            <br />
            •  You will need to be able to tell us the make and model of your mobile phone.
            <br />
            •  We may ask to see something that tells us that the items you are claiming for belong to you and confirms the make, model or IMEI number and memory size (where relevant) of your mobile phone.
            <br />
            <strong>If you purchase the policy through our app, we can assess this ourselves. However, if our app is not downloaded (might not be available for your mobile phone), you might need to provide proof of ownership.</strong>
            <br />
            Proof of ownership could include a till receipt or documentation from any online purchase, or from your network provider. If you don't have any proof of ownership we may decline your claim if we have reason to believe that your mobile phone might have been stolen before you owned it.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the IMEI number on the mobile phone has been tampered with we will decline your claim.
        </li>
        <li>
            Repairs by authorised repairer may be made using readily available parts, or we may provide refurbished products which may contain parts, which are of similar or equivalent specification, and which may include unbranded parts.
        </li>
        <li>
            We may require that you to pay any of the outstanding annual premium prior to settling any claim.
        </li>
        <li>
            This policy is provided in addition to any manufacturer's warranty that applies to your mobile phone (“applicable manufacturer's warranty”). In the case of Breakdown covered by the manufacturer's warranty, you should first claim on that warranty.
        </li>
        <li>
            Nothing in this policy is intended to affect your rights under the applicable manufacturer's warranty or your statutory rights. If any repairs authorised by us under this policy invalidate the applicable manufacturer's warranty, we will repair or replace your mobile phone, as necessary, in accordance with the terms of the applicable manufacturer's warranty for the unexpired period of the applicable manufacturer's warranty.
        </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div style="{{ column_two_margins }}">
    <ul>
        <li>
            When we replace the mobile phone, the replacement may be a reconditioned (not brand new) mobile phone.
        </li>
        <li>
            If we are unable to replace your mobile phone with the same make and model, we will contact you to discuss an alternative claim settlement.
        </li>
        <li>
            If any lost, stolen or damaged items are recovered after the claim is approved, they shall become the property of the insurer and must be returned to us immediately.  Accidental Damaged mobile phones, parts and materials replaced by us shall become the property of the insurer.
        </li>
        <li>
            At so-sure we treat our customers fairly and with respect so that we can handle valid claims promptly. This is a required process from our insurers and necessarily you must provide us with all information. Failure to do so will slow down the handling of your claim and could invalidate your policy. Please deal with our personnel with full respect at all times.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
        What if your claim is rejected?
    </h4>
    <p>
        If you're not happy with the claims decision, we want to hear from you as soon as possible.  Please follow the complaints process described in the section ‘Making an enquiry or complaint' below.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your claim for a lost or stolen mobile phone has been rejected then insurance cover for that mobile phone will cease. No further insurance premiums will be collected and your policy will be cancelled.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Fraud
    </h4>
    <p>
        We do not tolerate any aspect of fraudulent activity. We work closely and share data with other insurers, law enforcement agencies and airtime providers to identify fraud and support prosecution where the appropriate evidence exists. Our fraud team works tirelessly to prevent and detect fraud. We, and other organisations, may access and use the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies, from both the UK and from other countries. It is important that when applying for insurance, or submitting a claim you or anyone acting on your behalf must take reasonable care to answer all questions honestly and to the best of your knowledge. Failure to do so may affect the validity of your policy or the payment of your claim.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div style="{{ column_one_margins }}">
    <p>
        If false or inaccurate information is provided and fraud is identified then we will:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Not honour the claim and we will cancel your policy. If an Excess has been paid this will not be returned, this is not a penalty, this is to cover our administration costs.
        </li>
        <li>
            Report you to the relevant authorities and take legal action, if necessary, to recover any money already paid to you under this insurance policy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Put the details of the fraudulent claim onto a register of claims through which insurers share information to prevent fraudulent claims. A list of participants is available on request.

            Pass the details to fraud prevention agencies. Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information. Other organisations may also access and use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering, for example, when -

        Duration of this Policy (Period of Insurance)

    <p>
        This policy shall run for a period of one year, between the start date and expiry date shown on your policy schedule (inclusive), unless any of the following happen:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You cancel the insurance
        </li>

    <h4>
        Cancelling your insurance
    </h4>
    <p>
        If you elect to cancel your insurance within the 14 days after your policy start date, you will be entitled to receive a full refund, providing no claim has been made.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have not claimed, at all other time during your period of insurance you can cancel by giving us 30 days written notice. We will be entitled to collect premium from you for this 30 day period. If you pay by instalment this will mean we will collect one further monthly payment from you. If you pay an annual premium this will mean we will return any unexpired period to you. If you do wish to exercise your right to cancel your policy, you can do so at any time by contacting us by email <a href="mailto:support@wearesosure.com">support@wearesosure.com</a> or in writing at so-sure, P.O Box 2801, Stoke-On-Trent  ST4 9DN.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a claim has been made by you we will not return any premium and you must still pay us the remaining annual premium. If you do not pay the remaining amount of your annual premium, we will take legal proceedings against you to recover any outstanding premium amount and full reimbursement of any claims fulfilled. We have to do this because we don't want non-payers of premium to cause our honest customers see increased premium costs.
    </p>
    <p>
        We can cancel the insurance without notice if you do not pay the monthly premium when due, if you make a claim which we believe to be fraudulent or you have breached any of your policy terms and/or conditions.
