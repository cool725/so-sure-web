        <p class="lead"><strong>Everyone hates insurance. We believe that needs to change.</strong></p>
        <p>We are revolutionising insurance by providing consumers with a better, easier and up to 80% cheaper solution. We call this <strong>Social Insurance</strong>.</p>
        <p>Starting with mobile phones, so-sure’s ambition is to expand rapidly across consumer lines and geographies over the next few years.</p><br>
        
        <h2>Head of Marketing</h2>

        <p>We’re looking for a Head of Marketing to lead to the growth of an insurance revolution, as we expand into new insurance lines and across the world throughout 2017 and beyond. </p>

        <p>You will shape, test and optimise the story of so-sure in the never-ending pursuit of growth. As such, you will be responsible for devising ideas and messaging to capture customers regardless of channel or platform.</p>

        <p>Reporting directly into the CEO, you should be adept at discussing things like ASO, CAC and A/B tests and as you are story-telling.</p>

        <p>You will be collaborating with an awesome team of developers and designers. So we expect you to be as good at working as part of an agile team that loves to experiment, as you are at marketing a product.</p>

        <p>Supporting you, is a Marketing Executive, whose development you will be responsible for.</p>

        <p>You will be leading the marketing for so-sure in the UK; initially the existing product but then also the additional ones. You will refine the strategy to optimise the channels to acquire customers cost-effectively.</p><br>
