What we mean here is you must take care of your property and we ask you to use common sense in taking care of it. If in doubt ask yourself “Would I have left a pile of £500 in cash there and expect to find it when I return?” If the answer is no, then you should not leave your phone there either. Of course, we will take in consideration the specifics of your situation as, after all, we are here to have your back if a misfortune happens.</li>
