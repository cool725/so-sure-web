                                <p>Succeeding the hugely popular CAT S60, the S61 refines rather than rethinks; enhancing its predecessor’s stellar features to produce another industry leading rugged smartphone. CAT’s latest iteration boasts a more powerful thermal imaging sensor, a sharper laser measuring tool and a more refined ambient air sensor.</p>
                                <p>Be warned; the CAT S61 isn’t the shy, retiring type, having been unashamedly built for toughness. If the Samsung Galaxy S10 and iPhone 11 are likened to smartphone sports cars, the S61 is closer to an armoured truck. In fact, the rubberised back panel feels more like a car tyre than a smartphone chassis! But this is no accident; the S61 is built to both IP68 and IP69 standards and can survive drops of up to 1.8m – directly onto concrete.</p>
                                <p>And that’s not all - the raised ridge around the screen reinforces its durability, while its operating range of between -25-55°C enables uninterrupted functionality in the worst weather conditions.</p>
                                <p>Despite its rugged, reinforced construction, it’s best to err on the side of caution by adding <a href="{{ path('phone_insurance_make_model', {'make': 'Cat', 'model': 'S61'}) }}">CAT S61 insurance</a> to your handset package. After all – if you need a phone this tough, you probably have more reason than most to need it in full working order!</p>
