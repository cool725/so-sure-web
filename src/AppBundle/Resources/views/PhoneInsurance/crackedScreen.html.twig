                <p>Smashing your screen really is rubbish. A smashed screen can leave your phone totally unusable (and we know how much your phone can mean to you). If your screen is broken, smashed or cracked to the point where you cannot use your phone anymore then so-sure will replace or repair it within one working day. </p>
                <p>As we all know, a really common way for someone to crack the screen on their phone is by dropping it on hard ground. You can make sure that having to pick it up is the only inconvenience you’ll suffer by getting yourself a new trustworthy phone case. They also don’t have to be ugly - you can get some really cool ones now!
