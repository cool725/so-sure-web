As you have had an approved claim, and received a replacement phone on {{ policy.getApprovedClaims(true, true)[0].replacementReceivedDate|date }}, as per the so-sure terms and conditions you are liable for the remainder of the policy year.  Should you fail to make payments on your policy, it will be cancelled and you will be billed for the remainder of your policy premium of £{{ policy.getRemainderOfPolicyPrice|number_format(2, '.', ',') }}.  In the unfortunate case that you should you fail to make this payment, we will take legal action.
