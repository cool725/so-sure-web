<h2 id="rewardpot" data-title="How your Reward Pot works">Reward Pot</h2>

<p>Our concept is built on small scale mutualisation of risk between you and your friends and contacts (“Connections”) (and collectively “Group”). You will not be paid introductory fees. But if the performance of your Group produces good results
    together, then we will “reward” you by making premium rebates to you as set put below.</p>

<p>Your Group can be as small or large as you want but your Reward Pot is limited to 80% of the premium shown on your policy schedule (the Reward Pot Limit). For each member of your Group who joins within 60 days of the start date of your policy, £10
    is put into your Reward Pot, up to the Reward Pot Limit but this is reduced to £2 if one of your Group members makes a claim within your first 60 days of your policy start. For each member of your Group that joins after 60 days from the start of your
    policy], £2 is put into your Reward Pot, up to the Reward Pot Limit. Each of your Group members also has a Reward Pot associated to their Connections, which operates in the same way as yours (so money will also be added to their Reward Pot when you
    connect to them).
</p>

<p>Example of your Reward Pot value, if your insurance premium is £{{ maxPotValue }}
    and your group members join in the first 60 days:</p>

<h3 id="rewardpotvaluewhenthereareclaimsinyournetwork">Reward pot value when there are claims in your network</h3>

<ul>
    <li>If you claim, your Reward Pot value is turned to £0 (zero pounds), regardless of Group Members.
    </li>
    <li>If your Reward Pot is worth less than £40 and one of your Group claims, your Reward Pot is reduced to £0 (zero pounds).
    </li>
    <li>If your Reward Pot is worth £40 or more and one of your Group claims, your Reward Pot is reduced to £10 (ten pounds).
    </li>
</ul>

<p>For of every new policy renewal, you can choose to keep the same Group or change it. Hence, at the beginning of your Policy Period you will have the opportunity either a) to re-connect with your existing Group members, b) to change your Group
    Members had in the prior year or c) to add more connections to your Group (up until your Reward Pot is worth 80% of your insurance premium).</p>

<p>If your Group do not claim during your year of insurance, the Reward Pot is paid out to you. If you renew your policy with us for another year, your Reward Pot can either be:</p>

<ol>
    <li>applied as a credit to reduce your following year’s premium payment(s) ; or</li>
    <li>rebated to you as a lump sum payment..</li>
</ol>

<p>If you do not wish to renew your policy, we will pay you out in full the value of your Reward Pot as a lump sum payment.</p>
<!-- TODO: Could add in the actual Policy Dates here -->
<p>Lump sum payments are made within 45 days of your policy ending as long as none of your Group has submitted a claim for an event that took place before the end of your policy term. For example, if your policy ends on 3rd March and your Reward Pot
    was worth £48 and none of your Group submits a claim by 31st March, we will payout £48 to you by the 17th April.</p>

<p>Circumstances in which your Reward Pot will not be paid out to you:</p>

<ul>
    <li>you filed a claim which has been approved</li>
    <li>your policy has been cancelled within the last 12 months</li>
    <li>one of your Group files a claim relating to a Loss, Accidental Damage, Theft or Breakdown which took place during the Period of Insurance relating to your Reward Pot</li>
    <li>if we have paid out a claim for you.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you upgrade your mobile phone to a more expensive mobile phone mid-way through the Period of Insurance, we will amend your premium to reflect the mobile phone insured and adjust your Reward Pot and Reward Pot Limit accordingly. The first new
    Member admitted to your Group after the upgrade will be rewarded to you as if they had joined in the first 60 days of the Period of Insurance.
</p>

<p>If one of your Group’s mobile phone is no longer insured by so-sure part way through your annual policy, we will allow you to replace that connection at the same value within the 30 days following your connection leaving the service.</p>

<!-- TODO: Insert Promotion Copy -->

<p>All payments assume that no deduction is required by way of taxation. If we are obliged by law to make such deduction, then the Reward Pot payments shall be reduced accordingly.</p>

<p>What happens once you have reported your claim</p>

<p>When you have reported the claim to us, we will do the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>walk you through the simple claims process and tell you what information and documents you will need to provide for us to assess your claim.</li>
    <li>advise you how much Excess you need to pay, and how you can pay it. You will need to pay your Excess for every accepted claim before the claim is settled.</li>
    <li>once your claim is validated, aim to either repair your mobile phone within a few days or send you a replacement within one working day.</li>
    <li>We do understand that every claim can be quite different and we will make every effort to take this into consideration when we review a claim.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="whatyouneedtoknowabouttheclaimsprocess">What you need to know about the claims process</h3>

<ul>
    <li>We need to know that the mobile phone you are claiming for is yours or a family member’s (or owned by the business if this is a business policy):</li>
    <ul>
        <li>You will need to be able to tell us the make and model of your mobile phone.</li>
        <li>We may ask to see something that tells us that the items you are claiming for belong to you and confirms the make, model or IMEI number and memory size (where relevant) of your mobile phone.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>If you purchase the policy through our app, we can assess this ourselves. However, if our app is not downloaded (might not be available for your mobile phone), you might need to provide proof of ownership.</strong>
</p>
<p>Proof of ownership could include a till receipt or documentation from any online purchase, or from your network provider. If you don’t have any proof of ownership we may decline your claim if we have reason to believe that your mobile phone might
have been stolen before you owned it.</p>

<ul>
<li>If the IMEI number on the mobile phone has been tampered with we will decline your claim.</li>
<li>Repairs by authorised repairer may be made using readily available parts, or we may provide refurbished products which may contain parts, which are of similar or equivalent specification, and which may include unbranded parts.</li>
<li>This policy is provided in addition to any manufacturer’s warranty that applies to your mobile phone (“applicable manufacturer’s warranty”). In the case of Breakdown covered by the manufacturer’s warranty, you should first claim on that warranty
</li>
<li>Nothing in this policy is intended to affect your rights under the applicable manufacturer’s warranty or your statutory rights. If any repairs authorised by us under this policy invalidate the applicable manufacturer’s warranty, we will repair or
    replace your mobile phone, as necessary, in accordance with the terms of the applicable manufacturer’s warranty for the unexpired period of the applicable manufacturer’s warranty</li>
<li>
    Where we replace the mobile phone the replacement may be a reconditioned (not brand new) mobile phone</li>
<li>If we are unable to replace your mobile phone with the same make and model, we will contact you to discuss an alternative claim settlement</li>
<li>If any lost, stolen or damaged items are recovered after the claim is approved, they shall become the property of the insurer and must be returned to us immediately. Accidental Damaged mobile phones, parts and materials replaced by us shall become
    the property of the insurer</li>
<li>At so-sure we treat our customers fairly and with respect so that we can handle valid claims promptly. This is a required process from our insurers and necessarily you must provide us with all information. Failure to do so will slow down the handling of your claim and could invalidate your policy. Please deal with our personnel with full respect at all times.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="whatifyourclaimisrejected">What if your claim is rejected?</h3>

<p>If you’re not happy with the claims decision, we want to hear from you as soon as possible. Please follow the complaints process described in the section ‘Making an enquiry or complaint’ below.</p>
<p>If your claim for a lost or stolen mobile phone has been rejected then insurance cover for that mobile phone will cease. No further insurance premiums will be collected and your policy will be cancelled.

<h2 id="fraud" data-title="In short, we don't tolerate fradulent activity.">Fraud</h2>

<p>We do not tolerate any aspect of fraudulent activity. We work closely and share data with other insurers, law enforcement agencies and airtime providers to identify fraud and support prosecution where the appropriate evidence exists. Our fraud
team works tirelessly to prevent and detect fraud. We, and other organisations, may access and use the information’ recorded by fraud prevention agencies, from both the UK and from other countries. It is important that when applying for insurance, or
submitting a claim you or anyone acting on your behalf must take reasonable care to answer all questions honestly and to the best of your knowledge. Failure to do so may affect the validity of your policy or the payment of your claim.</p>

<p>If false or inaccurate information is provided and fraud is identified then we will:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Not honour the claim and we will cancel your policy. If an Excess has been paid this will not be returned, this is not a penalty this is to cover our administration costs</li>
<li>Report you to the relevant authorities and take legal action, if necessary, to recover any money already paid to you under this insurance policy</li>
<li>Put the details of the fraudulent claim onto a register of claims through which insurers share information to prevent fraudulent claims. A list of participants are available on request.</li>
<li>Pass the details to fraud prevention agencies. Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information. Other organisations may also access and use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering, for example, when:

    <ul>
        <li>Checking details on applications for credit and credit related accounts or facilities</li>
        <li>Managing credit and credit related accounts or facilities</li>
