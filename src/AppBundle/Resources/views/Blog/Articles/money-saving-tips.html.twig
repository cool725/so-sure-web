                        <p>How to pocket yourself a little extra cash from now up until (dare I say it) Christmas 2018 ðŸ˜³</p>
                        <p>Everyone (well nearly everyone) is in the same financial boat. Working, getting paid, living it large and then waiting for pay day! In these summer months it is expensive, lots of drinks to buy in the sun, summer holidays on the beach. Anyway, as its summer, and we are not detoxing our bodies, weâ€™re here to show you how to perform a financial detox on your wallet.</p>
                        <h2>Switch up your bank account</h2>
                        <p>Thereâ€™s plenty of choice...</p>
                        <p>People stick with their bank accounts for an inordinate amount of time. The average person in the UK <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/sep/07/switching-banks-seven-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stays with their bank longer than they manage to stay married</a>. Why people have this kind of personal attachment to their bank Iâ€™ll never know. However, Banks are aware of this, which is why they offer massive benefits just for switching. High Street Banks such as HSBC and First Direct will give you straight cash (up to &pound;150) just for changing to them. Not bad.</p>
                        <p>While you may be thinking, isnâ€™t it a massive hassle to change my bank, I mean I have to notify my work, change my utility bills, update my direct debit... Well, fear not, because since 2013, the FCA have ensured that each <a href="https://www.currentaccountswitch.co.uk/Pages/Home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bank makes it as easy as possible now</a>. Most banks will do their utmost to ensure that the process is as pain-free as possible. In fact, all you really need to do is notify them that you want to switch and theyâ€™ll take care of the rest.</p>
                        <p>And then there are the challenger banks, which we love like <a href="https://www.starlingbank.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Starling</a> and <a href="https://monzo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monzo</a>. These guys are doing banking for the 21st century, no fees, easy to switch and online support. Nice!</p>
                        <h2>Manage your bills</h2>
                        <p>Make a few changes and you could gain Â£Â£Â£'s</p>
                        <p>This might seem like a fairly obvious one but itâ€™s something that most people donâ€™t care to think about in their daily lives. Even just a few tweaks can help you save a few pounds. For instance, if you turn down your thermostat by one degree you can <a href="http://www.energy-uk.org.uk/customers/save-money-on-energy-bills.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">save around &pound;85 per year</a> (thatâ€™s nearly as good as so-sure).</p>
                        <p>Other ways to save money on your domestic bills is by switching out the energy inefficient things in your home. Old school bulbs may look nice but they sap money out of your wallet like a leech. Energy efficient bulbs last longer and use less electricity so save you a good amount of money in the long run.</p>
                        <p>Thatâ€™s the thing about these incremental changes. You wonâ€™t notice the saving immediately but over the long-term you definitely will. Maybe next time January comes round youâ€™ll be in an even better position.</p>
                        <h2>Change your insurance!</h2>
                        <p>The insurance world can be a bad and scary place.</p>
                        <p>We know insurance is rubbish (thatâ€™s why we created so-sure). However, it is a necessary evilâ€Šâ€”â€Šinsurance is pretty darn useful when you lose your phone or damage your property. They are also kind of expensive. We think we negate that by offering you the opportunity to get money back when you donâ€™t claim. If you and your friends donâ€™t claim then weâ€™ll give you up to 80% back ðŸ’°</p>
                        <p>You could potentially time it now so that by the end of the year youâ€™ll have collected a little <a href="{{ path('social_insurance') }}">Reward Pot</a> cash to ease the January financial blues (provided you and your friends donâ€™t claim of course).</p>
                        <h2>Switch utility providers</h2>
                        <p>Websites such as USwitch make it easier than ever to make savings.</p>
                        <p>This is something most people only research when they move into a new house. After youâ€™ve set up the internet and chosen an electricity or gas provider, you tend to just pay the providers and forget about it all. However, if you donâ€™t check, you wonâ€™t know whether youâ€™re still getting a good deal.</p>
                        <p>Similarly to your bank account, you should have a look at <a href="https://www.uswitch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">switching</a> up your <a href="https://www.comparethemarket.com/energy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">utility bill</a> providers. Things such the cost of your internet and also your electricity bills can really vary from area to area so itâ€™s worth having a look to see how you can benefit.</p>
                        <h2>Change your phone bill</h2>
                        <p>Get the right deal and you can call someone on their cellphone all day/night long ðŸ“ž</p>
                        <p>I think itâ€™s safe to say that we know a little bit about phones at so-sure which is why we always make sure we get the best deal with our providers. One of the biggest mistakes that people make is that they still pay the same price for their premium handset even after theyâ€™ve paid off the initial contract. By that point you fully own the phone so you are free to change the network in order to get the cheapest deal.</p>
                        <p>Thereâ€™s loads of decent SIM only deals out there and it doesnâ€™t take much effort to find a good one. Check out <a href="https://www.giffgaff.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">giffgaff</a> or <a href="http://www.three.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Three</a> for some pretty awesome all-inclusive bundles.</p>
