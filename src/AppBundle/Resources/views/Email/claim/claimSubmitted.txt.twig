Hi {% if user.name %}{{ user.name }}{% else %}{{ user.email }}{% endif %},

What happens now?

Relax. We’re here to help and get your claim sorted as soon as possible!

1. We will contact you by phone within 4 hours, unless it's after 5pm, then we'll try the next working day. Please don't ignore a call from a withheld number – it's probably us

2. If we can't reach you by phone, we will email you. Look out for an email from:mbx.valid8@davies-group.com (they are our friendly claims team)

We do contact everyone, so if you think you haven't heard from us within 24h of submitting your claim, check your spam folder, voicemail or text messages.

In case you really haven't heard from us within 24h, give us a call on: 03450744839 and we’ll give you an update on your claim.

Best,
Team SO-SURE
