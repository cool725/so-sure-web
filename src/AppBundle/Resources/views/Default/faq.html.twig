                                    <p>We launched SO-SURE in 2016 because we wanted to revolutionise our industry by making insurance fairer, more straightforward and less expensive for honest consumers worldwide.</p>
                                    <p>Our mission is to turn the insurance industry on its head by giving our customers better prices and the customer care they deserve.  We believe in being honest and fair to our customers.</p>
                                    <p>We launched a revolutionary new social insurance concept that is fast, fair, easy and excellent value for you and your family and friends.</p>
                                    <p>We protect our customers when they claim and reward them when they don't.</p>
                                    <p>SO-SURE is inspired by the origins of insurance. In the Seventeenth Century - when the idea of insurance was born out of the ship-owner community - insurance was how it should be. Insurance was designed around the customer, if no-one claimed, they got their money back, and if one of the ships went down, everyone chipped in.</p>
                                    <p>As the world of commerce changed, so too did the insurance industry.  Insurance Companies started to care less about the customer and more about profits.  In turn, trust in insurance providers plummeted, prices went up, fairness and good customer service disappeared.</p>
                                    <p>At SO-SURE, we're on a mission to make insurance even better â€“ fast, fair, easy and great value.</p>

                                    <p>Traditional insurers exist to make big fat profits. They keep the money that they don't pay out on claims.  This means whenever they pay a claim, they lose money. This is why getting your claim approved and paid is so very painful...all they want to do is keep your money. Is that fair?</p>
                                    <p>SO-SURE is different. Our whole business is built around putting you, the customer, first. That's why we decline less than 4% of claims because we believe insurance should have your back when you need it and also reward you for being careful.</p>
                                    <p>We also treat the money you pay as your money.  We believe that people are better together, and that's why we've created social insurance that gives cashback when there are no claims.</p>

                                    <p>The Reward Pot is a group no claims bonus we give to customers.</p>
                                    <p>We give a Reward Pot to everyone who buys insurance with us and then connects with their friends and family.</p>
                                    <p>How it works - you buy a policy and invite a friend to <span class="text-nowrap">SO-SURE</span>. Your friend buys a policy, and then you connect with each other, you both receive Â£10 into your reward pots.  You can invite and connect with members of your family, friends and colleagues.</p>
                                    <p>If four friends connect to you, you get Â£40 in your reward pot, and each one of them gets Â£10 in theirs.  Eight friends connected with you, that's Â£80 in your reward pot, Â£10 in each of theirs.</p>
                                    <p>If none of you or your connections makes a claim, we will pay out to you the value of your reward pot at the end of the policy year.</p>
                                    <p>So honest, careful people get money back at the end of each 12-month policy if there have been no claims made.</p>

                                    <p>The IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identification) is a unique identification code specific to your mobile phone.  It is not your phone number. It is a code that is unique to each handset.  If you change your handset, you must call us to update your policy with the correct details.</p>
                                    <h5 class="h6">For Android users:</h5>
                                    <p>The easiest way to find your phone's IMEI number is to simply dial *#06# if you're on an Android device.</p>
                                    <p>If you're still having trouble, then you should be able to find it in Settings > About phone > Status > IMEI information.</p>
                                    <p>If requested by support, you can take a screenshot on most Android phones by holding the volume down and the power buttons for 1-2 seconds. The screen should flash, and the photo can be found in your photos app.</p>
                                    <h5 class="h6">For Apple users:</h5>
                                    <p>You will find your IMEI by going to Settings > General > About - and take screenshots. You will need to scroll down to see your IMEI number. IMEI number can also be found by simply dialing *#06#.</p>
                                    <p>If you're using our app (or if requested by support), you can take a screenshot by pressing the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons at the same time until you see the screen flash quickly.</p>

                                    <p>Accidental damage is when something happens to your phone that is entirely out of your control.</p>
                                    <p>Usually, it is something that other insurance companies try to add-on to your existing plan for an extra fee - which is pretty weird - how can you be expected to prevent something that is out of your control?</p>
                                    <p>Examples of accidental damage:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Spillages: this is one of the most common causes of an accidental damage claim. You would think that people would stop dropping their phones in pints, but they never seem to learn.</li>
                                        <li>Damage by children: You are protected even if they aren't your children! You can't really hold a child responsible for their actions.  Insurance against accidental damage protects you from kids breaking your stuff.</li>
                                        <li>Damage caused by pets: We all love animals, but they sometimes tend to break our stuff. It would be smart to get insurance if you have pets.</li>
                                        <li>Electrical surges: Incredibly unlikely, but it does happen (especially during lightning storms). A power overload can permanently damage a phone.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </div>

                                        <li>Damage resulting from you putting your phone at risk: If you do something like leaving your phone behind on the train, we can't really be responsible.</li>
                                        <li>Damage caused before the insurance policy: We might be great, but we're not that great. Replacing a phone for damage that happened before we started looking after you doesn't make much sense.</li>

                                    <p>Hold your phone approximately 10cm/4in away from the mirror and keep it steady.  Your phone will vibrate once the phone is in the correct position. Make sure to keep it still. When you feel a second vibration, the photo has been taken.  Done</p>
                                    <p>If you don't feel the vibration, make minor adjustments to the phone's position, go slowly back and forward. You can tilt the phone slightly as well.  You should also see a little preview from the camera when the phone is held up, so make sure the camera sees the QR Code.</p>
                                    <p>Then review the photo displayed, ensure that your entire phone is visible and if it is, submit the image; otherwise, try the process again.</p>
