    <p><strong>iPhone XR</strong>is the most remarkable phone released by Apple in 2018, all things considered (TechRadar). The first thing that came to attention with this iPhone model is the better than brand-average battery, then &ndash; of course &ndash; the price, considering the hardware phones in the X series have.</p>
    <p>Specs and features wise, XR has a splendid design with vibrant colours, large and bright 6.1-inch screen, Apple's A12 Bionic chip &ndash; fastest processor in a phone (Tom's Guide), excellent audio quality and that long-lasting battery, among others.</p>
    <p><em>Psst! so-sure insurance also covers accessories of up to &pound;100 (inc VAT) for theft or loss claims.</em></p>
