                                Simplest way to explain the Reward Pot is a “group no claims bonus”. We give you the chance to connect with friends and family. For each one that buys insurance with us and connects with you, we'll add up to £10 to both you and your friend/family member’s Reward Pots. Your Reward Pot for the {{ phone }} can reach up to £{{ max_pot }} (e.g. 80% of your annual policy price). If neither you nor your friends/family claim in the year, we will payout to you the value in the Reward Pot. Click <a href="#"

                                There is no minimum size of your Reward Pot group: you can decide not to connect to anyone and still enjoy the benefits of a fully insured phone, but then you won’t get up to 80% of your money back at the end of the year. The {{ phone }} is limited to a maximum of {{ max_connections }} Reward Pot connections. If you have {{ max_connections }} connections and none of you claim, you can get  back at the end of your policy year, every year you have a so-sure policy.

                                We understand how inconvenient it is to be without your phone. Thus if your device is damaged or broken, we will aim to repair it the next working day, or in times when it takes longer, we will provide you with a next working day replacement phone. If your phone is lost or stolen, we will provide you with a replacement phone next working day. Your replacement phone may be new or refurbished; rest assured the refurbished phone will look like new and work exactly the same. Regardless, your replacement phone will be covered under your existing policy.
