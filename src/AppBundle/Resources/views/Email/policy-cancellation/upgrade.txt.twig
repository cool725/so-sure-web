------------------------------------------------------------
You've requested a policy upgrade. Due to the way our system works, we will be cancelling your previous policy and creating a new policy.

This email serves as official notice that your policy {{ policy.policyNumber }} is now cancelled and no longer in effect.

You should expect another email shortly with your new policy details and confirmation of coverage, however, should payment fail, you will need to complete purchase of the new policy on our website or app.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us (support@wearesosure.com).
