        Hi {{ data.policy.user.name }},
        <br><br>
		Thank you for starting your claim, but please note at this point <strong>your claim has not been submitted</strong> as you still need to provide additional information.
        <br><br>
		In order to submit and proceed with your claim, you will need you to upload the necessary documents as outlined to you in the online claims portal. Failure to do so will result in delays to your claim. 
        <br><br>
		If you need to come back at a later time, simply enter your email using the link below. 
        <br><br>
		You will then receive another email to login to your account, which is valid for 2 hours (due to security reasons). 
        <br><br>
		{{ macros.email_button_table(url('claim_login'), "CLICK HERE TO LOGIN", "CLICK HERE TO LOGIN")}}
        <br><br>
