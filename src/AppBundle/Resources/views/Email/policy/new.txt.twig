Important boring bits:

- Policy starts: {{ policy.start | date('d M Y', 'Europe/London') }}
- Policy ends: {{ policy.end | date('d M Y H:i', 'Europe/London') }}

{% if policy.phone.newHighDemand %}
Note: As you have a shiny new model, we wanted to let you know your next day replacement or repair may be an older model, just for a few days until we get the new model to you - this is an unusual occurrence that's out of our control and due to market shortages.
{% endif %}

Cover includes: Loss, Theft, Accidental Damage, Out of Warranty Breakdown, Accessories, Global Travel üòç.

Attached is a copy of all your key documents, including your policy terms for reference. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to contact us.
