                <ol>
                    <li>When facing the mirror with the QR code gently move the phone forwards and backwards so the front camera can see the QR code.</li>
                    <li>Tilt the phone forward slightly so the phone is held at 45 degrees angle.</li>
                    <li>When the phone detects the QR code you will feel a vibration, the screen will then go white (as the device is taking a picture) and you will feel a second vibration.</li>
