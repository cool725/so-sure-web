IMPORTANT LEGAL INFORMATION

If you fail to make payment in time, your policy will be cancelled and, as you have already had a
claim approved, you will then be expected to pay in full the remainder of your annual premium.

In the unfortunate case that you do not pay the remainder of your policy premium, we will be forced to take legal proceedings against you.

Please login to your account to see your policy T&amp;Cs and review your legal obligations:
