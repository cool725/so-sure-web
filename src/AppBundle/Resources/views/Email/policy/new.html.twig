			   Your {{ policy.phone }} has recently beeen released and is high demand. This means that should you need to claim
			   on your phone over the next couple of weeks, we may have delays in sourcing parts and/or a replacement device for you.
			   In the case of repairs, this might involve an additional couple of days, or in the case of replacement,
			   we will be able to offer you a slight older model phone as loan for a week or 2 until we are able to get a replacement device to you.
