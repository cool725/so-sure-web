Thank you for joining so-sure.  We're excited to have you onboard.

Your policy is for {{ policy.phone }} and runs from {{ policy.start | date('d M Y H:i', 'Europe/London') }} to {{ policy.end | date('d M Y H:i', 'Europe/London') }}.

We've also attached a copy of all your key documents, including your policy terms for reference. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us (support@wearesosure.com).

We take fraud very seriously and will always take steps to prosecute when fraudlent behaviour is present. We would remind you that you previously confirmed that your phone is currently in full working condition and your screen is not cracked. If that is not the case, we will exercise our right to cancel the policy and will report the fraud to the police.
			   
Given this notice, if you think you have purchased this policy by mistake, please email us today.

Subject: Please cancel {{ policy.policyNumber }} as my phone was damaged prior to purchase

We will then cancel the policy and refund you the full amount.
