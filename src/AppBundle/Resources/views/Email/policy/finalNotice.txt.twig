Final notice before legal action - Payment due

Hi {{ policy.user.firstName }} {{ policy.user.lastName }},

We have tried to contact you numerous times via email and SMS about the outstanding amount due on your policy. It is your legal obligation to pay the remaining amount of your policy premium.

If you continue to refuse to pay the outstanding amount, we will consider the contract void and therefore, by law, will seek to put both parties in the same position before the contract started, which will mean that we will commence formal proceedings take legal action to recover the full cost of the replacement phone that you received. The legal actions might affect your credit score.

This is the last opportunity for you to pay us the outstanding due on your policy before we take legal action to recover the cost of your replacement phone. Once we have started any form of legal proceedings, you will no longer be able to settle by paying the remainder of your policy and instead we will be seeking to be paid the full cost of your replacement phone.

We would prefer not to take legal action because we believe people are fundamentally honest but if you don't pay the outstanding amount, you will give us no choice but to consider other options for recovering the debt which is due to us.
