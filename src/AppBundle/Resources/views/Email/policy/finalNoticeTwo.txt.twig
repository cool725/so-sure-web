2nd Notice - Outstanding Payment Due - Action will be taken

Hi {{ policy.user.firstName }} {{ policy.user.lastName }},

Sadly, your so-sure policy has now been cancelled.

However as per the contract to which you agreed in taking out our policy, once you have had a successful claim, you are liable to pay the outstanding amount of the premium.

We hope that you will honour your side of our agreement by paying the remaining premium just as we honoured our side by fulfilling your claim.

If not, please be aware that we do take legal action on outstanding payments which may affect your credit score.

Please login to your account to make your outstanding payment:

Regards,
so-sure
