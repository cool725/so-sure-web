                            Download our app and prove to us your device is in good working order and the screen isn't cracked by taking a selfie of your phone!

                            So, if something unfortunate happens and you haven't validated your phone with our app you will need to pay up to &pound;100 extra for any loss, damage or theft claims.

                            Excess levels vary by make, model and memory size and might be higher for latest, most-expensive new handsets.
