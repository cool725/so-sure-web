Sorry, please attempt to validate again ⚠️

Hi {{ policy.user.firstName }},

😔 Unfortunately, the photo you sent in didn't quite give us enough information to validate your phone. Please re-launch the app and re-try the process making sure that the photo you upload has the full phone in the photo.

{% if additional_message|length > 0 %}
🤔 Additionally, please keep the following in mind:

{{ additional_message }}
{% endif %}

{% if policy.status == 'picsure-required' %}
Your cover will NOT start until you have successfully validated your phone!
{% else %}
Have another go to reduce your excess by &pound;100! 😆
{% endif %}

Open the app: {{ branch_pot_url }}

Have a question or issue? Contact us: {{ contact_us_url }}
