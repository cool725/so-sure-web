               Hi {{ user.name }},<br><br>
               You recently cancelled your direct debit with so-sure. This does not automatically
			   cancel your policy with so-sure.
			   <br><br>
			   You can easily setup your direct debit again (or switch to debit/credit card payments)
			   by logging into your account at https://wearesosure.com.
			   <br><br>
			   {% if claimed %}
				   Your contract with so-sure is for a 1 year period.  If you have had a successful claim
				   during that period you will be liable for the remainder of the premium due.
			   {% else %}
				   Should you wish to cancel your policy with so-sure, please email us at support@wearesosure.com.
