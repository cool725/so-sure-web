                    <p>Traditional insurers exist to make big fat profit margins. They keep the money that they don't pay out on claims. This means whenever they pay a claim, they lose profit. This is why getting your claim approved and paid is so very painful... they want to keep your money.</p>
                    <p><strong>so-sure has been designed differently</strong>. Our whole business is built around putting you, the customer, first. That's why we decline less than 4% of claims - because we believe insurance should have your back when you need it and also reward you for being careful.</p>
                    <p class="mb-5">We also treat the money you pay as your money, and we believe that people are better together, and that's why we've created insurance that's social and gives money back when there's no claims.</p>
