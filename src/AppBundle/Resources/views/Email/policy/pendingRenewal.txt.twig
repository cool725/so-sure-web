It’s time to renew with so-sure 📱

Dear Dear {{ policy.user.name }},

We're just emailing to let you know that your so-sure policy {{ policy.policyNumber }} is due to expire on {{ policy.end | date('d M Y', 'Europe/London') }}.

Your renewal premium will be £{{ policy.nextPolicy.premium.monthlyPremiumPrice|number_format(2, '.', ',') }} per month.

For comparison the premium paid last year was £{{ policy.premium.monthlyPremiumPrice|number_format(2, '.', ',') }} per month.

The excess for your policy is
{% if (policy.policyTerms.isPicSureEnabled and policy.picSureStatus == 'approved') or (policy.policyTerms.isPicSureEnabled and policy.picSureStatus == 'preapproved')  %}
Damage claims: &pound;{{ policy.nextPolicy.premium.picSureExcess.damage }}
Warranty claims: &pound;{{ policy.nextPolicy.premium.picSureExcess.warranty }}
Loss and Theft Claims: &pound;{{ policy.nextPolicy.premium.picSureExcess.loss }}
{% else %}
Damage claims: &pound;{{ policy.nextPolicy.premium.excess.damage }}
Warranty claims: &pound;{{ policy.nextPolicy.premium.excess.warranty }}
Loss and Theft Claims: &pound;{{ policy.nextPolicy.premium.excess.loss }}
{% endif %}

You should check that the level of cover is appropriate for your needs and, if you wish, compare prices and over offered by other providers.

{% if policy.potValue > 0 %}

We also see that you’ve been busily filling up your Reward Pot, which is now worth £{{ policy.potValue|number_format(2, '.', ',') }} 💰

Provided that neither you nor your connections make a claim before the end of your current policy, your monthly premium will be reduced to £{{ policy.nextPolicy.premium.getAdjustedStandardMonthlyPremiumPrice(policy.potValue)|number_format(2, '.', ',') }}. If you’d prefer a different arrangement (such as a lump-sum payment or policy termination) click here:

{{ renew_url }}

If we don’t hear from you, we will automatically renew your policy and use your Reward Pot to reduce your premium for the coming year, starting on {{ start_date | date('d M Y', 'Europe/London') }}. Once renewed, we will send you a confirmation email that will include your new policy documents.

{% else %}

We noticed that you haven’t been filling up your Reward Pot, which would have added up to £{{ policy.maxPot|number_format(2, '.', ',') }} over the last year.

Remember that every connection you make on so-sure earns money for your Reward Pot, which can reduce your premium. To fill up your Reward Pot, after you’ve renewed your policy, all you need to do is share your personal code with friends and family. Why not give it a try?

If we don’t hear from you, we will renew your policy, starting on {{ start_date | date('d M Y', 'Europe/London') }}. Once renewed, we will send you a confirmation email that will include your new policy documents.

{% endif %}

Thank you for choosing so-sure and please don't hesitate to get in touch with any questions.

Best regards,

Dylan Bourguignon
