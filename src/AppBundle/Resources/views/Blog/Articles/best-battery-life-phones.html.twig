                                <p>Despite every element of technology advancing since smartphones first reached world-altering levels of popularity in the early 2010s, we still tolerate bad battery life in our mobile phones. It’s even written into the architecture of public buildings and transport, with charging ports now readily available on buses, trains, and in almost every coffee shop, museum, or library.</p>
                                <p>Many people have taken to charging their phones using a portable charger, or if you're out and about for the day you may have to stop for a coffee to use a charging port. But it’s 2020 now – although the 7-day battery life of the original mobiles we loved in the 1990s and 2000s is perhaps far behind us, it's definitely time to expect more from our phones. With technology advancing all the time, why can’t we have a reliable battery life?</p>
                                <h2>What should I look out for?</h2>
                                <p>Battery capacity is measured in milliamp hours (mAh), the higher the mAh, the higher the capacity. But although a phone might seem to have a large battery, there are other factors to consider too – like the efficiency of the processor, as well as how much you will use your phone.</p>
                                <p>If your screen time reports show you use your phone for 6+ hours a day, your battery life is sure to take a hit. If your phone comes with a fast charging cable, you’re less likely to need a phone with a large battery capacity.</p>
