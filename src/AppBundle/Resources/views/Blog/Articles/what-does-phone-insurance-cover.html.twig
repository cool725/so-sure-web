                                <p><a href="{{ path('phone_insurance') }}">Mobile phone insurance</a> covers the cost of repairing or replacing your phone, but policies are often more intricate than that and it’s important to know exactly what you’re covered for before making a claim. Understanding the details of your policy will increase the chances of you making a <a href="{{ path('claim_phone_insurance') }}">successful claim</a>. In this article, we’ll outline what you’re covered for under mobile insurance to help you know when you’re eligible for a pay-out.</p>
                                <h2>What’s covered by SO-SURE phone insurance</h2>
                                <p>We’ve all been guilty of dropping our phones or leaving them on public transport but having mobile insurance cover gives you peace of mind that you can quickly get repairs or a replacement. There are a number of different ways you can lose or damage a phone, and it’s useful to know exactly what you can claim for. Below we answer some commonly asked questions regarding our policy.</p>
                                <h3>Does my phone insurance cover accidental damage?</h3>
                                <p>Yes, we cover accidental damage, so you don’t need to panic when you drop your phone and find it face down. We still recommend using a case though!</p>
                                <h3>Does my phone insurance cover cracked screens?</h3>
                                <p>This comes under accidental damage, and we will cover any repairs to <a href="{{ path('how_to_fix_cracked_phone_screen') }}">damaged, scratched or broken screens</a>.</p>
                                <h3>Is water damage covered by phone insurance?</h3>
                                <p>It doesn’t matter if you’ve been out in the rain, accidently gone for a swim with it in your pocket, or even dropped your phone down the toilet, all water damage is covered by us.</p>
                                <h3>Everything that’s covered</h3>
                                <p>A full list of everything you’ll be covered for with SO-SURE mobile phone insurance:</p>
                                <ul>
                                  <li>Theft and loss as standard</li>

                                </ul>
                                <p>You’ll be covered as soon as you sign up with us, but we won’t pay out for any existing claims you carry over.</p>
                                <h2>What’s not covered by SO-SURE phone insurance?</h2>
                                <p>It’s equally as useful to know what you’re not covered for, saving you wasting your time making a claim you won’t receive any repairs or replacement for.</p>
                                <p>We won’t cover you for:</p>
                                <ul>
                                  <li>Any existing claims before you bought our insurance</li>
                                  <li>More than 2 claims for Loss and/or Theft in any policy year</li>
                                  <li>Claims where you’ve knowingly put your mobile phone at risk</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>When your claim is reviewed, the information provided will be used to determine whether you’re eligible for phone repairs or replacement. If you are deemed to have been careless with your phone, for example, driving off with your phone on the roof of the car or leaving your phone unattended in a public place, your claim may get rejected.</p>
                                <p>It’s also worth noting that many insurers only cover phones up to a certain age. In this case, you’ll be covered for new, used or refurbished phones up to three years old.</p>
                                <h2>Should I buy phone insurance?</h2>
                                <p>Whether or not you should buy mobile phone insurance very much depends on your financial position, attitude to risk, and put simply, how clumsy you are. You should ask yourself:</p>
                                <ul>
                                  <li>If my phone was lost, damaged or stolen, could I afford to replace it?</li>
                                  <li>Am I prone to breaking and losing things?</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>If you’re someone who isn’t prone to losing or breaking your phone and could afford to replace it and still have cash spare for essentials such as food and bills, then mobile phone insurance cover might not be for you. However, if replacing a smartphone could put you in financial difficulty or you’re someone who is regularly losing or breaking things, it might be time to invest in some cover, it’ll save you money in the long run!</p>
