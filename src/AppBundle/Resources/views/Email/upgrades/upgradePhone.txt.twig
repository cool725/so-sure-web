âœ… Policy Upgrade Successful ðŸ“±

Dear {{ policy.user.firstName }},

Congratulations, you have successfully upgraded your policy and your <strong>{{ policy.phone }}</strong> is now insured.

Attached are your policy documents and schedule, or you can log in to your account to view them online:

{{ url('user_policy_list_policy', {'id': policy.id }) }}

In order to reduce your excess with us, you will need to use our app to verify this phone is in great working order:

{% if policy.phone.isITunes %}
Download our iOS App, login, and complete the validation process.
{{ url('download_apple', {'medium': 'pic-sure-upgrade-email'}) }}
{% elseif policy.phone.isGooglePlay %}
Download our Android App</a>, login, and complete the validation process.
{{ url('download_google', {'medium': 'pic-sure-upgrade-email'}) }}
{% else %}
Just email a picture of your phone's screen in the mirror to support@wearesosure.com and we'll get started on that process.
{% endif %}

Please note: verification and excess reduction completed on your last phone will not be carried forward to this upgraded policy!
