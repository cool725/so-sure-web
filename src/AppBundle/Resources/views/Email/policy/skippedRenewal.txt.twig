Your so-sure insurance is unable to be automatically renewed 😢

Dear {{ policy.user.name }},

We emailed you a few week ago about automatically renewing your SO-SURE policy {{ policy.policyNumber }}.

Unfortuantely, we were unable to automatically renew your policy as your previous policy was either cancelled or unpaid.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to email us at support@wearesosure.com.
