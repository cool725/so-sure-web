Welcome to the so-sure family!

You've made a very smart decision. Never again will you have to worry about dropping your phone and seeing that cracked screen, or it being stolen by some pesky thief!

Starting now, you can also be on your way to receive 80% of your money back at the end of your policy year when you connect with friends or family and none of you claim. You can share your unique code now here {{ policy.getStandardSCode.code }}.
{{ url('scode', {code: policy.getStandardSCode.code}) }}

Now enough about us, here's your policy details:

Your policy is for a {{ policy.phone }} and runs from {{ policy.start | date('d M Y H:i', 'Europe/London') }} to {{ policy.end | date('d M Y H:i', 'Europe/London') }}.

Cover includes: Loss, Theft, Accidental Damage, Out of Warranty Breakdown, Accessories, Global Travel

Attached is a copy of all your key documents, including your policy terms for reference. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us.

{% if policy.policyTerms.isPicSureEnabled and policy.picSureStatus != 'preapproved' %}
Your excess is currently £150, however, you can easily reduce this amount to £50 (£70 for Theft/Loss) by validating your phone with pic-sure.
{% if policy.phone.isITunes %}
Download our iOS App, login, and complete the pic-sure validation process.
{{ url('download_apple', {'medium': 'pic-sure-welcome-email'}) }}

{% elseif policy.phone.isGooglePlay %}
Download our Android App</a>, login, and complete the pic-sure validation process.
{{ url('download_google', {'medium': 'pic-sure-welcome-email'}) }}

{% else %}
Just email a picture of your phone's screen in the mirror to support@wearesosure.com and we'll get started on that process.

{% endif %}
{% endif %}
{% if policy.phone.newHighDemand %}
As you have a shiny new model, we wanted to let you know your next day replacement or repair may be an older model just for a few days until we get the new model to you (this is an unusual occurrence that's out of our control and due to market shortages).

Cancel your policy now if your phone already has a cracked screen.

We take fraud very seriously and do prosecute. When you purchased your policy, you confirmed that your phone was in full working condition and without a cracked screen. If you failed to disclose the state of your phone accurately, we may exercise our right to cancel the policy and will report any instance of fraud to the police.

If you think you might have purchased your policy by mistake, please go to the following url today to cancel your policy and receive a full refund of your premium.
