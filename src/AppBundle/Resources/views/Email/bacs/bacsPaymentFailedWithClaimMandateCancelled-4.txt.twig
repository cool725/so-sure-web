Action required to keep your phone insured

Your monthly Direct Debit payment failed for the final time and your policy will be automatically cancelled in 7 days.

If you fail to make payment in time, your policy will be cancelled in {{ policy.policyExpirationDateDays }} days! ðŸ˜±

To avoid losing insurance for your {{ policy.phone }}, you need to login to your account and make a payment for the outstanding balance of Â£{{ policy.premium.getAdjustedStandardMonthlyPremiumPrice }}.

Pay outstanding balance: {{ branch_payment_details_url }}

IMPORTANT LEGAL INFORMATION

If you fail to make payment in time, your policy will be cancelled and, as you have already had a claim approved, you will then be expected to pay in full the remainder of your annual premium.

In the unfortunate case that you do not pay the remainder of your policy premium, we will be forced to take legal proceedings against you.

Please login to your account to see your policy T&amp;Cs and review your legal obligations:
