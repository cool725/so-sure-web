Your Direct Debit Cancellation

**
------------------------------------------------------------
Hi {{ user.name }},

You recently cancelled your direct debit with so-sure.

This does not automatically cancel your policy with so-sure.

You can easily setup your direct debit again (or switch to debit/credit card payments) by logging into your account at https://wearesosure.com.

{% if claimed %}
Your contract with so-sure is for a 1 year period.  If you have had a successful claim during that period you will be liable for the remainder of the premium due.
{% else %}
Should you wish to cancel your policy with so-sure, please email us at support@wearesosure.com.
{% endif %}
