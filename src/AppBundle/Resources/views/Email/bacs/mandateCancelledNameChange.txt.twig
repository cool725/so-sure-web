Your Recent Name Change

Hi {{ user.name }},

You recently changed your name on your so-sure policy.

As part of our security measures, we require that our direct debit bank accounts match our policy holder names. Due to your name change, this is no longer the case with your policy and so we have had to cancel your existing direct debit.

You can easily setup your direct debit again (or switch to debit/credit card payments) by logging into your account at https://wearesosure.com.

Alternatively, if you are in the middle of a name change and your bank account is still in your previous name, please do let us know and we can re-enable direct debit (we may need a document or two).

Please login to your account to see your policy T&amp;Cs and review your legal obligations:
{{ url('user_policy_list_policy', {'id': policy.id}) }}

Have a question or issue? contact us: {{ contact_us_url }}
