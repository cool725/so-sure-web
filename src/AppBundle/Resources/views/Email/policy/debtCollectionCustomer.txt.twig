Debt collection process started

**
------------------------------------------------------------
This is to inform you that we have started a debt collection process for policy {{ policy.policyNumber }}.

Your phone {{ policy.phone }} was insured and you received a replacement phone on {{ policy.getApprovedClaims(true, true)[0].replacementReceivedDate|date }}.
As per so-sure terms & conditions, the remainder of the policy must be paid for in full.

Your current debt for the amount of Â£{{ policy.getRemainderOfPolicyPrice|number_format(2, '.', ',') }} was due on {{ policy.end | date }}

You can make online payment at:  {{ url('purchase_remainder_policy', {'id': policy.Id }) }}
