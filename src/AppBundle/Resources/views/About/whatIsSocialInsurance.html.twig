            	<p>Social Insurance (or so-sure for short) is a new way of looking after your possessions <strong>by allowing you to connect you with people that you love and trust</strong>.</p>
				<p>After all, the collective is always stronger than the individual! so-sure gives you the opportunity to get together with your friends and provided you're careful, collect a juicy reward at the end.</p>
                <h3>Reward Pot</h3>
                <p>If no-one in your group claims, you could get up to 80% of your premium back at the end of the year, every year. The more people you connect with (who don't claim), the <strong>more money you get back</strong>.</p>
                <p>There's no hidden small print to trip you up or flaming hoops to jump through â€“ just download our mobile app and you'll be covered in seconds.</p>
                <h3>Better insurance</h3>
                <p>Had an accident? Lost your phone? Give our UK-based claims team a call 365, 24/7 and once your claim has been approved, we will aim to get you a replacement phone the next working day!</p>
                <p>Many insurers have been getting away with treating their customers poorly for years. We think that it's about time there was a better, easier and cheaper service. That time is now.</p>
