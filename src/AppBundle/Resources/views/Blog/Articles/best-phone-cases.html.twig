                                <p>With each new major phone release, there are thousands of accessories that flood the market within weeks, usually including a huge choice of phone cases. With that many phone cases available, there’s always bound to be one that suits your needs, but how are you supposed to choose it?</p>
                                <p>Figuring out what you want your case to be best suited to is the first step in making your decision. Depending on your requirements, you might be looking for one that matches your style, waterproofs your handset, or offers the absolute best protection from bumps and drops.</p>
                                <p>We've compiled a list of some of the best phone cases judged on both protectivity and looks, so that you can choose a case that protects your phone without compromising its design.</p>

                                <p>Compatible with Apple, Samsung and Android smartphones, the Otterbox Defender protects your phone against drops and dust, as well as safeguarding your screen from scratches and cracks. This is well known to be one of the most protective phone cases on the market, made from reinforced polycarbonate and silicone to absorb impact. It even comes with port covers to prevent your phone's sockets from getting dirty. If the bulky phone case isn’t for you, but you still want the reassurance of a protective phone case, Otterbox has a whole host of more streamlined designs to choose from.</p>

                                <p>The Mous Limitless 2.0 case is ideal for those who require a more slimline design but don’t want to compromise on protection. Available in five different real-material designs, choose the one that best suits your look. We like the Walnut, but it’s also available in aramid fibre, bamboo, black leather or shell. A particularly good feature is its ability to be used with AutoAlign magnetic accessories. The flex mount and vent mount provide handsfree usage, whilst the card wallet will keep your bank cards close to hand.</p>

Made from hard plastic, the cases are coated in rubber to provide extra grip, and they help protect the camera and buttons as well as your phone’s body against scratches, dirt, bumps and water damage. The Nudient Thin is so popular because of its ultra-minimal design.
