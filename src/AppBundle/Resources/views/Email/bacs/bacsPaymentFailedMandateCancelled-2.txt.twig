Your payment failed for a 2nd time!

Since your Direct Debit for account {{ policy.getPolicyOrUserBacsBankAccount.getDisplayableSortCode }} {{ policy.getPolicyOrUserBacsBankAccount.getDisplayableAccountNumber }} was cancelled, we've been unable to take your monthly payment.  

Without a valid payment method in place you will lose you cover in {{ policy.policyExpirationDateDays }} days 😱

To keep your {{ policy.phone }} insured against loss, theft & damage, please set up a new Direct Debit now. 

It only takes a minute! 👍
