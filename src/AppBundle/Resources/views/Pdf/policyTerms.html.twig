Reward Pot
Our concept is built on small scale mutualisation of risk between you and your friends and contacts (“Connections”) (and collectively “Group”). You will not be paid introductory fees. But if the performance of your Group produces good results together, then we will “reward” you by making premium rebates to you  as set put below.. The Group to which you belong can be as small or large as you want but your [Reward Pot] is limited to 80% the premium shown on your policy schedule (the [Reward Pot] Limit). For each member of the Group who join within 60 days of the start date of your policy, £10 is put into your Reward Pot, up to the Reward Pot Limit. For each member of the Group that join after 60 days of the start of your policy or if one of the Group members makes a claim within your first 60 days of your policy start, £2 is put into your Reward Pot, up to the Reward Pot Limit.  For example, if your insurance premium is £60 and your Group members join in the first 60 days, your Reward Pot is worth:
  </div>
  <pagebreak>
  <div style="{{ column_one_margins }}">
    <p>
        Reward Pot value when there are claims in your Group
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If you claim, your Reward Pot value is turned to £0 (zero pounds), regardless of Group Members. 
        </li>
        <li>
            If your Reward Pot is worth £40 or more and one of your Group, your Reward Pot is reduced to £10. 
        </li>
        <li>
            If your Reward Pot is worth less than £40 and one of your Group, your Reward Pot is reduced to £0 (zero pounds). 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        At the end of every year, you have the opportunity to either a) re-connect with your existing Group, b) change your Group Members had in the prior year or c) add more connections to your Group (up until you Virtual Pot is worth 80% of your insurance premium). 
    </p>
    <p>
        If your Group do not claim during your year of insurance, the Reward Pot is paid out to you. If you renew your policy with us for another year, your Reward Pot can either be
    </p>
    <ol type="i">
        <li>
            applied as a credit to reduce your following year’s premium payment(s) ; or
        </li>
        <li>
            rebated to you as a lump sum payment.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        If you do not wish to renew your policy, we will pay you out in full the value of your Reward Pot as a lump sum payment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lump sum payments are made within 45 days of your policy ending as long as none of your Group has submitted a claim for an event that took place before the end of your policy term. For example, if your policy ends on 3rd March and your Reward Pot was worth £48 and none of your Group submits a claim by 31st March, we will payout £48 to you by the 17th April.
    </p>
    <p>
        Circumstances in which your Reward Pot will not be paid out to you:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            your policy has been cancelled within the last 12 months             
        </li>
        <li>
            one of your Group files a claim relating to a Loss, Accidental Damage, Theft or Breakdown which took place during the Period of Insurance relating to your Reward Pot            
        </li>
        <li>
            you filed a claim            
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you upgrade your mobile phone to a more expensive mobile phone mid-way through the Period of Insurance, we will amend your premium to reflect the mobile phone insured and adjust your Reward Pot and Reward Pot Limit accordingly. The first new Member admitted to your Group after the upgrade will be rewarded to you as if they had joined  in the first 60 days of the Period of Insurance. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If one of your Group’s mobile phone is no longer insured by so-sure part way through your annual policy, we will allow you to replace that connection at the same value within the 30 days following your connection leaving the service. 
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Network: tell your network provider as soon as you can
            <br />
            It is important to contact your network to block your mobile phone and SIM card as soon as possible if your mobile phone is lost or stolen. We may ask for evidence of this to support any claim for the Loss or Theft of your mobile phone. This must be done within 7 days of Loss or Theft, but if you wish to claim for any unauthorised network charges you will need to report the Theft/Loss to your network provider within 24 hours of the Theft/Loss.              
        </li>
        <li>
            Police: report it to the Police within 7 days
            <br />
            You must report any Loss or Theft of your mobile phone to the Police, and obtain a crime or loss reference number. The claims team will ask you for the crime reference number when you lodge your claim. This must be done within 7 days of Loss or Theft.
            <br />
            If you have difficulty reporting your incident to the Police please contact us and we can help to guide you.

            Last place: Report any Loss/Theft to the place you believe it has been lost or stolen from
            <br />
            You never know: they might have kept it aside for you. So we expect you to report your mobile phone as lost or stolen to the place you think it has been lost or stolen from.
            <br />
            We may ask you to provide the details of where your mobile phone was lost or stolen from and actions you have taken to try to recover it

    <p>
        We do not tolerate any aspect of fraudulent activity.

We, and other organisations, may access and use the information’ recorded by fraud prevention agencies, from both the UK and from other countries. It is important that when applying for insurance, or submitting a claim you or anyone acting on your behalf must take reasonable care to answer all questions honestly and to the best of your knowledge. Failure to do so may affect the validity of your policy or the payment of your claim.
